# UNO Game

## Overview
This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic card game Uno. The game allows a player to compete against a bot, following the standard rules of Uno, including special cards like "Draw Two," "Wild," and "Wild Draw Four."

## How to Play
1. **Starting the Game**: Click the "Start Game" button to begin. You will be dealt 7 cards, and the game will display the current card in play.
2. **Playing a Card**: 
   - You can play a card if it matches the color or value of the current card in play.
   - If you play a "Wild" or "Wild Draw Four" card, you will be prompted to choose a color.
3. **Drawing a Card**: 
   - If you cannot play a card, click the "Draw Card" button to draw a card from the deck.
   - If the drawn card is playable, you can play it immediately.
4. **Ending the Turn**: After playing a card or drawing a card, the bot will take its turn automatically.
5. **Winning the Game**: The game continues until either you or the bot runs out of cards. The player who gets rid of all their cards first wins the game.
